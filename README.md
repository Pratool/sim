# Simulator

## Building Software
### Dependencies
Currently, the simulator depends on [OGRE v1.12](https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre).
The preferred method of installing this dependency is to use CMake and build it as an external project.
Read the external project documentation (in `external/README.md`) for more info.
